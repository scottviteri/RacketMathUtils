Includes and verifies an embedding of the 8th dihedral group in 2 by 2 matrices over Z/5Z.
This was found by searching for Z/nZ such there was an eigth root of unity and there was an x st 2x^2=1.
This procedure could likely be generalized to other dihedral groups dN where the vertices are representable in terms of radicals -- namely where the odd prime factors of N are Fermat primes.
